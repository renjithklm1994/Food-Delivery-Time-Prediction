## üß† Machine Learning Model

We used a **Logistic Regression** model to classify whether a delivery will be **on time (1)** or **delayed (0)**.

### üîç Features Used:
- `Traffic_Conditions`
- `Weather_Conditions`
- `Delivery_Person_Experience`
- `Distance_feature`
- `Order_Time`
- `Rush_hour`

###  Target Variable:
- Binary classification:
  - `0` ‚Üí Delayed
  - `1` ‚Üí On Time

##  Observations

- **Distance** and **delivery person experience** have the strongest positive influence on on-time deliveries.
- The model performs better at predicting delayed orders (recall = 0.72) than on-time ones (recall = 0.39).
- Overall accuracy is moderate (53.75%) and could be improved.
